It's a GUI application using the tkinter library. The application generates a QR code based on the details entered by the user in the GUI.

In the "Student Details" section, the user can enter the student's name, roll number, branch, current year, and college.
The user can then press the "Generate QR" button to generate a QR code based on the entered details.
The generated QR code is displayed in the "Student QR Code" section.
